# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# @editor = User.create(email: "editor1@example.com",
#                       password: "password123",
#                       password_confirmation: "password123",
#                       role: "editor")
# puts "Done: Editor Seeded. \n"

# 10.times do
#   @post = Post.create(title: Faker::Company.catch_phrase,
#               body: Faker::Lorem.paragraphs,
#               published: false, author_id: @editor.id )
#   puts "Created sample post #{@post.title} \n"
